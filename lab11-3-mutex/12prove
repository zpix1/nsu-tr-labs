[] - wait
{} - work

2 mutexes - 4 states
3 mutexes - 8 states

2 workers in the same room - indeterminate behaviour, we can't decide who exit

[A] {B} - is not possible, indeterminate behaviour
if one goes to other room, we can't decide who'll go to the empty room:
[A, B] {}

[] {} [] - is not possible with 2 mutexes, system has 6 states:

[A] {B} []
[A] {} [B]
[] {A} [B]
[B] {A} []
[B] {} [A]
[] {B} [A]
-> goto 1
